    "## What is the course about? \n",
    "\n",
    "Prompting engineering tips for developers. We will be covering best practices, tips, advanced prompt engineering techniques, and much more. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Who is it for?\n",
    "\n",
    "For developers with experience with Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "At least basic knowledge of Python is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preparation Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Setup API Key\n",
    "\n",
    "Set up an API Key with OpenAI. Sign up for a paid account here: https://platform.openai.com/. You need at least a Tier 1 account. Once done, you can generate an API key. Save that key in a `.env` file in your root folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Download the code\n",
    "\n",
    "Please download the folder at this link to get started: [Get Code](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zXdHJ3IcCtDGcoVS8nhAqulk2x8B18Nj?usp=sharing)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Setup the environment\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conda\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't have conda, you can install it [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once installed, run the following command to create a new environment called `pe-for-devs`. \n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "conda create -n pe-for-devs python=3.10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, activate the conda environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "conda activate pe-for-devs\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python environment\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't want to use conda, you can create a virtual environment using Python's `venv` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "python3 -m venv .venv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, activate your environment (the command below is for Linux)\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "source .venv/bin/activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Install the packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, install the dependencies inside the `requirements.txt` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code in the notebook labeled `getting_started.ipynb`\n"
